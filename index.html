                        <p>A tutoring session is an active learning experience in which you will not only fix your code,
                            but learn new career skills while doing so.</p>
                        <p>Students who engage in tutoring progress more quickly through the course than those who
                            don't, and are more likely to succeed.</p>
                        <p>Tutors can help you to understand course concepts that you're unclear on, interpret
                            documentation and error messages, and develop troubleshooting skills that will prove
                            invaluable in the industry.</p>
                        <p>Tutors will teach you how to resolve your issues, rather than fixing them for you. Please do
                            not enter a tutoring session with the expectation of an easy fix - the learning process can
                            be long and difficult, but will be worth it in the end.</p>
                        <p>With that in mind, tutors will frequently ask students to carry out various tasks. Students
                            are expected to actively participate in these tasks as they constitute the majority of the
                            learning experience (i.e. learn by doing).</p>

                                <p><b>Your Problem Statement</b></p>
                                <p>A general statement like <i>"my project isn't working"</i> is not conducive to a
                                    successful tutoring session.<br>
                                    A good problem statement contains two things - a concise description of your issue,
                                    and the steps you've taken so far to try to resolve it.<br>
                                    Start by asking yourself <i>why</i> your project isn't working. The following is an
                                    example of a well-formed problem statement:<br>
                                    <i>I have written a CSS rule which should make all of the images on my index.html
                                        200px wide. I have imported the CSS file at the top of index.html, but the style
                                        is not being applied.<br>
                                        I have tried examining the page using the browser's dev tools in order to see
                                        what the issue might be, but I can't seem to figure it out. The styles aren't
                                        listed in there either!</i>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text-left">
                                <p><b>Your Learning Outcome</b></p>
                                <p>At the simplest level, if your code doesn't work, and you can't fix it, the goal is
                                    to learn <i>how</i> to fix it.<br>
                                    However, as we've already seen, a well written problem statement is more detailed
                                    than my code doesn't work. A specific part of your code doesn't work, and it will
                                    involve its own specific troubleshooting process.<br>
                                    Your learning outcome is a clear statement of what you want to learn in the tutoring
                                    session. If you're just starting out on the course, then don't worry! <i>"I don't
                                        know"</i> is always an acceptable answer, and if your HTML or CSS isn't working
                                    and you have no idea how to start fixing it, then that's your first learning
                                    outcome!<br>
                                    The following is an example of a well-defined learning outcome for the previous
                                    example:<br>
                                    <i>In the past I have learned to use dev tools to modify and test my CSS styles, but
                                        they're not even showing up in it now. I need help learning more advanced
                                        debugging tips as my current debugging skillset is failing me here.</i>

                        <p><b>Patience</b></p>
                        <p>Troubleshooting is a process. It is sometimes a very long process. It is always a very
                            repetitive process.<br>
                            In the software world, it can take days to track down and fix a single bug. You're unlikely
                            to encounter anything quite so complex here, but on occasion, tutoring sessions can take
                            longer than you'd expect or involve a considerable amount of drudgery. This is a core part
                            of programming, and cannot be avoided.</p>
                        <p><b>Usage</b></p>
                        <p>The average student uses about 45 minutes of tutoring per week.<br>
                            If you find yourself using more tutor time than that on a regular basis, you may be relying
                            on tutoring too heavily in order to solve your code problems for you.<br>
                            If you find this happening, please feel free to chat to either us or Student Care about any
                            concerns you may have.<br>
                            If you are using less time than that, then please feel free to frequent tutoring more
                            regularly. Irrespective of whether you're stuck or not, we're happy to answer any general
                            course-code related questions you may have.</p>
